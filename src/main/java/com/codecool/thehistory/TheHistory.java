 * START THE ASSIGNMENT BY READING/UNDERSTANDING THIS FILE!

 *
 * If we want to implement functionalities which share common features with different implementations we can use
 * an interface.
 * An interface is a Java type. It is like a specialized class: mostly with instance method declarations, without
 * implementation (in Java 8 default methods has implementation /check out replace()/ and there are changes in
 * newer Java versions as well).
 * If a concrete (not abstract) class implements an interface it should implement all it's methods.
 *
 * Why is it good? Because if a class implements an interface we can use polymorphism to access the class' instance
 * through any of the interface it implements. That's what we are using in the TestTheHistory.java to avoid duplicate
 * test case implementations.
